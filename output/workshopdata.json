  "Description": "[b]WARNING: do not use this mod on a save that you care about![/b] This mod [i]will[/i] (I think irreversibly without reverting your save) erase the creatures that normally spawn on your save and replace them with scavengers.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h1]PORLGATORY[/h1]\r\nOops, all scavs! This mod turns pretty much every creature that spawns into a scavenger (exceptions provided below). If you have Downpour, some of them have a chance to be [spoiler]elites[/spoiler] as well. The mod does a few other things too :)\r\n[h3]What got spared[/h3]\r\nThe following creatures are spared from turning into scavengers:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Slugcats\r\n[*](DLC) [spoiler]Slugpups[/spoiler]\r\n[*]Overseers\r\n[*]Scavengers (and all variants)\r\n[*]Deer (to make farm arrays possible)\r\n[*]Vulture grubs\r\n[*](DLC) [spoiler]Mother spiders[/spoiler]\r\n[*](DLC) [spoiler]Some other creatures (including yeeks) exclusively in ??? ;)[/spoiler]\r\n[/list]\r\nThe following are [i]not[/i] creatures (by the game\u0027s code) and will not be turned into scavengers:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Jellyfish\r\n[*]Iterators\r\n[*]Neuron flies\r\n[*]Echoes\r\n[*]Void worms\r\n[/list]\r\n[h3]Bugs and other stuff[/h3]\r\nThis mod caused a lot of issues in testing (due to the fact that I\u0027m making the game do things it shouldn\u0027t be doing), and although I\u0027ve tried to squash as many as I could find, there are probably some still lurking out there. If you find any bugs, let me know in a discussion forum how to reproduce them and if it\u0027s there, send exceptionLog.txt (will be located in your game installation folder).\r\nThis mod [i]should[/i] in theory work with custom creature mods, but I haven\u0027t tested any. Just a warning that stuff may not work.",
